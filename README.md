## Biostatistics Mini Project

In this mini project, we analyze data from a cohort of women to determine the likelihood of experiencing a miscarriage, normal labor, or premature birth. Utilizing a variety of descriptive analysis techniques, we thoroughly explore and organize the data, creating informative graphs to visualize our findings. This project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing pregnancy outcomes and to enhance our understanding through comprehensive data analysis.
